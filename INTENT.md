A personal MCP server that serves my own opinionated coding guidelines to coding agents via the Model Context Protocol. The server fetches and exposes structured content—such as language-specific rules, naming conventions, review checklists, and architecture principles—from local or remote sources like markdown files or version-controlled repositories. It is developed in Python using Astral uv tooling (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and using FastMCP (https://gofastmcp.com/). The final version of the app  will be accessible to my projects via the uvx CLI directly from a GitHub repository (uvx run github:myusername/myrepo). This will only be a MVP version so no future improvements for now.
