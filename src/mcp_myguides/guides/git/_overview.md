# Git Guidelines overview

## âœ… Core Git Rules

* Make always sure that .gitignore is up-to-date and does include all essential exclusions. Be especially careful with secrets.
* Never commit directly to `main`.
* Always create a **separate branch** for each feature or fix.
* Once your work is complete and tested, **merge it into `main` locally**.
* After merging, run your tests to verify nothing is broken. Optionally run the app manually if needed.
* Keep commit messages clear and focused.
