# Python Development Guidelines Overview

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the Python development guidelines, designed to ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency across our projects. These guidelines cover various aspects of the development lifecycle, from setting up your environment to deploying and maintaining your applications.

## Key Areas Covered:

*   **Documentation:** Learn about our standards for user, internal, and API documentation, and how we use tools like MkDocs.
    *   To dive deeper, try: `list_guides tags=['python', 'documentation']`
*   **Environment and Dependency Management:** Understand how to effectively manage your Python environments and project dependencies using `uv`, including strategies for pinning versions and resolving conflicts.
    *   To dive deeper, try: `list_guides tags=['python', 'environment-management']`
*   **General Principles:** Explore the overarching principles guiding our Python development, including when it's acceptable to deviate from guidelines and critical "red lines" that must never be crossed.
    *   To dive deeper, try: `list_guides tags=['python', 'general']`
*   **Preferred Libraries:** Discover the recommended libraries for various application, development, and testing needs, ensuring we leverage robust and maintainable tools.
    *   To dive deeper, try: `list_guides tags=['python', 'libraries']`
*   **Security:** Implement best practices for secrets and configuration management, and utilize tools like Bandit for security analysis to build secure applications.
    *   To dive deeper, try: `list_guides tags=['python', 'security']`
*   **Source Code Standards:** Adhere to our coding style, type hinting requirements, and documentation standards, enforced by tools like Ruff and MyPy.
    *   To dive deeper, try: `list_guides tags=['python', 'code-standards']`
*   **Testing:** Embrace a test-first development philosophy, covering unit, integration, and end-to-end testing strategies with Pytest and Playwright.
    *   To dive deeper, try: `list_guides tags=['python', 'testing']`
    *   For end-to-end testing specifics, try: `list_guides tags=['python', 'e2e', 'playwright']`

By following these guidelines, we aim to foster a collaborative and productive development environment, leading to high-quality and maintainable Python applications.
